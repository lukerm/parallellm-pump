_______

The expression \( e^{i\pi} \) is equal to \( -1 \). This result is a specific case of Euler's formula, which states:

\[
e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x)
\]

When \( x = \pi \), we can substitute and evaluate:

\[
e^{i\pi} = \cos(\pi) + i\sin(\pi)
\]

From trigonometry, we know that:

\[
\cos(\pi) = -1 \quad \text{and} \quad \sin(\pi) = 0
\]

Thus, substituting these values into Euler's formula gives:

\[
e^{i\pi} = -1 + i\cdot0 = -1
\]

This leads us to the elegant conclusion:

\[
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
\]

This equation, known as Euler's identity, beautifully relates five fundamental mathematical constants: \( e \), \( i \), \( \pi \), \( 1 \), and \( 0 \).

______

`e^{i\pi} = -1`

This is Euler's famous identity. It follows from Euler's formula `e^{ix} = cos(x) + i*sin(x)`. When x = π, we get `e^{iπ} = cos(π) + i*sin(π) = -1 + 0 = -1`, since cos(π) = -1 and sin(π) = 0.

This remarkable equation connects five fundamental mathematical constants: e, i, π, 1, and 0 (when written as e^{iπ} + 1 = 0).

chatgpt
_______

1. Response 1 (chatgpt)
2. Response 2 (claude)

- Response 1 (chatgpt) provides a more comprehensive explanation of Euler's formula and discusses its implications, making the reasoning clearer.
- It maintains a structured format with detailed steps, which enhances readability and understanding.
- Response 2 (claude) is concise but lacks depth and doesn't explain the significance of Euler's identity as thoroughly as Response 1 (chatgpt).

claude
______

1. Response 1 (chatgpt)
2. Response 2 (claude)

Reasoning for ranking:
* Response 1 (chatgpt) provides a more structured and detailed explanation, using proper mathematical notation and breaking down the steps clearly
* Response 1 (chatgpt) shows the mathematical progression step-by-step, making it easier to follow the logic
* While Response 2 (claude) is correct and concise, it lacks the mathematical rigor and formal presentation that makes Response 1 (chatgpt) more academically appropriate
* Response 1 (chatgpt)'s use of proper LaTeX formatting for equations makes it more visually clear and professional

Both responses are factually correct and mention the same key points, but Response 1 (chatgpt)'s presentation and thoroughness make it the superior answer for explaining this mathematical concept.
